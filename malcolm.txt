Below are some quotes by the great Malcolm X.

You’re not to be so blind with patriotism that you can’t face reality. Wrong is wrong, no matter who does it or says it.

A man who stands for nothing will fall for anything.

We cannot think of being acceptable to others until we have first proven acceptable to ourselves.

Truth is on the side of the oppressed.

You can’t separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.
